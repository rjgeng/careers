# Prepare for a job

you **don’t** need to learn **everything** listed above to find a job as a **Linux Backend Engineer**—the roadmap is a comprehensive guide for mastery, but you can land a job **much earlier** by focusing on the **core essentials** first.

##  💡 What You Need to Learn to Get Your First Job (Priority List)

If your goal is to get a job **quickly**, focus on these **essential skills first**:

##  🟢 **Phase 1: Must-Have Skills (3-6 months)**

1️⃣ **Linux System Basics**

-   Command-line usage (grep, awk, sed, tmux)
-   Process management (ps, kill, top, htop)
-   Networking (netstat, curl, iptables)
-   Basic shell scripting (bash, cron jobs)

2️⃣ **Programming in C or Python (Choose One or Both)**

-   C: System programming, file handling, sockets, threading
-   Python: Flask/FastAPI, database interaction (PostgreSQL)

3️⃣ **Backend API Development**

-   Build a simple REST API with C (mongoose) or Python (Flask)
-   Connect it to a database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)

4️⃣ **Databases (SQL)**

-   Learn PostgreSQL: SQL queries, indexes, optimization
-   Basic NoSQL (Redis for caching)

5️⃣ **Version Control (Git)**

Learn `git clone`, `git branch`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git pull`

6️⃣ **Basic System Administration**

-   Deploy a basic web app using NGINX + Gunicorn + Flask
-   Run your app inside Docker

##  🟡 **Phase 2: Mid-Level Skills (6-12 months, Optional but Beneficial)**

These will **increase your job opportunities** but are not necessary to get your first job:

-   **GoLang** (Fast-growing backend language)
-   **Advanced SQL & Query Optimization**
-   **Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**
-   **Scaling with Load Balancers (HAProxy, Nginx)**
-   **Basic Kubernetes for deployment**

##  🎯 **How to Get Hired Faster?**

✅ **Build & Showcase Real-World Projects** (GitHub portfolio)
✅ **Apply to Junior Backend Engineer, DevOps, or System Engineer roles**
✅ **Network on LinkedIn, GitHub, and join Linux Backend communities**
✅ **Prepare for technical interviews** (DSA is not as important for backend, focus on system design & Linux knowledge)
