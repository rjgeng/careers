---

## Default 30-Second Version (Recommended)

> I document my career the same way I build systems.  
> I keep ATS-safe resume artifacts, interview prep, and role selection in one place so the process is deliberate rather than random.  
> Everything there is non-proprietary and meant to show how I think, not just what I’ve done.

---

## If They Ask “Why Did You Build This?”

> After enough cycles, I realized job search behaves like a system with inputs, filters, and failure modes.  
> Treating it explicitly helps me stay focused and interview-ready without noise.

---

## If They Ask “Is This a Side Project?”

> No — it’s infrastructure. My production work lives in separate repos.  
> This just keeps my positioning and preparation clean.

---

## If They Ask “What Should I Look At?”

> The career-as-a-system overview and the system design notes are usually enough.

---

## Stop Rule

Once you’ve answered, **stop talking** unless they ask follow-ups.

Clarity beats elaboration.
