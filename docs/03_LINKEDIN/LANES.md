# LinkedIn Lanes

LinkedIn is a **public verification + discovery surface**.

For hiring stakeholders, it is often used to answer four quiet questions:

1) Is this person real and consistent?  
2) Do they look stable and competent?  
3) Does their story align with the resume/portfolio?  
4) Any obvious red flags?

This module defines **lanes** (target contexts) and the language patterns that work in each lane.

## Lane Definitions

### Lane I — Institutional / Public Sector
Use when targeting:
- government, universities, labs
- utilities, regulated infrastructure
- public-adjacent B2B where compliance and auditability matter

Optimize for:
- reliability, documentation, auditability
- long-lived systems, maintainability
- human-in-the-loop automation / AI

Avoid:
- “agentic”, “autonomous”, “AI-first”
- long vendor/model name lists
- “move fast and break things”

---

### Lane P1 — Private Tech (Balanced)
Use when targeting:
- established private companies
- teams that value shipping but still expect stability and clean operations

Optimize for:
- shipped outcomes, ownership, end-to-end delivery
- practical systems and integration work
- clear scope + measurable execution

Avoid:
- exaggerated titles (“guru”, “10x”)
- overclaiming impact without proof

---

### Lane P2 — Startup (Execution-Heavy)
Use when targeting:
- early-stage or high-velocity teams

Optimize for:
- speed-to-production with responsible engineering
- high ownership, iteration, pragmatic tradeoffs
- shipping demos and product proof

Avoid:
- sounding chaotic or unfocused
- claiming “autonomous AI” without governance
- “I can do everything” without artifacts

---

### Lane P3 — Public-Adjacent B2B (Delivery + Trust)
Use when targeting:
- contractors, integrators, vendors selling to government/regulated customers

Optimize for:
- delivery discipline, customer trust
- maintainability, SLAs, operational readiness
- documentation and reviewability

Avoid:
- consumer-startup hype language
- vague claims without customer/problem context

---

## Common Guardrails (All Lanes)

### Do
- Keep Headline and About **scannable**
- Keep facts consistent with resume/portfolio
- Pin 2–4 strong Featured artifacts (proof > words)
- Prefer concrete verbs: built, shipped, maintained, integrated, improved

### Don’t
- Don’t list model/vendor names as identity
- Don’t use “world-class”, “thought leader”, “10x”
- Don’t rebrand frequently
- Don’t imply unsafe autonomy (“agents run production”) without human oversight and logging

---

## Minimum Viable LinkedIn Profile (MVLP)

Always ensure these are correct:
- Headline: lane-appropriate, role-specific
- About: 6–10 lines; what you do + how you work + proof pointer
- Featured: 2–4 best artifacts only
- Experience: dates/titles match resume
- Skills: top 10 match your real work

---

## When to Switch Lanes

Switch lanes when your target market changes for 30+ days.

If switching:
1) Update Headline + About
2) Reorder Featured
3) Adjust top skills
4) Keep Experience factual and stable
