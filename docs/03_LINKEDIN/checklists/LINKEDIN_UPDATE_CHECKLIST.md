# LinkedIn Update Checklist

Goal: Update LinkedIn quickly without introducing inconsistency or hype.

This checklist assumes you already chose a lane:
- Institutional/Public (Lane I)
- Private (P1), Startup (P2), or Public-adjacent B2B (P3)

---

## 1) Pre-flight (2 minutes)

- [ ] Choose lane (I / P1 / P2 / P3)
- [ ] Choose role template (Backend / UIUX / Embedded-Systems)
- [ ] Confirm the target titles (1–3) you want recruiters to see

---

## 2) Headline (2 minutes)

- [ ] Replace headline using the selected template + lane
- [ ] Remove vague claims (“AI expert”, “open to anything”)
- [ ] Keep it scannable (no long lists)

Pass condition:
- headline matches your actual work and target roles

---

## 3) About (5 minutes)

- [ ] Replace About with template text (6–10 lines)
- [ ] Remove vendor/model name lists
- [ ] Keep one proof pointer (“see Featured”)
- [ ] Ensure tone matches lane (I = reliable/auditable; P2 = shipping/ownership)

Pass condition:
- About says what you do + how you work + where proof is

---

## 4) Featured (5 minutes)

- [ ] Pin only 2–4 best artifacts
- [ ] Ensure links work and are public-safe
- [ ] Order: strongest proof first
- [ ] Remove weak/old/duplicative items

Suggested sets:
- Engineer: repo/demo + design note + write-up (+ optional resume)
- Designer: portfolio + case study + case study/prototype (+ optional)

Pass condition:
- a reviewer can understand your capability in 30 seconds

---

## 5) Experience Consistency (5 minutes)

- [ ] Job titles match resume (no inflation)
- [ ] Dates match resume
- [ ] 2–4 bullets per role, duty-focused
- [ ] Remove contradictory or outdated claims

Pass condition:
- no “timeline mismatch” between LinkedIn and resume

---

## 6) Skills Ordering (3 minutes)

- [ ] Put top 10 skills that match the target role
- [ ] Systems/reliability skills first (especially Lane I / P3)
- [ ] AI skills included only if true, not as identity
- [ ] Remove skills you cannot defend in interview

Pass condition:
- top skills reflect real work and desired roles

---

## 7) Settings (Optional, 2 minutes)

- [ ] “Open to work” enabled for recruiters only (recommended)
- [ ] Titles are specific (avoid “AI Engineer” alone)
- [ ] Locations/remote preferences are accurate

---

## 8) Recruiter Message Handling (Optional)

Use a fit-check reply:
> Thanks for reaching out. I’m open to roles aligned with my current focus (see headline). If you share the job description, location/remote expectation, and stack, I can quickly confirm fit and availability.

---

## Final Sanity Check (30 seconds)

- [ ] No hype words you can’t defend
- [ ] Proof is visible in Featured
- [ ] Resume and LinkedIn tell the same story
