## About (Copy/Paste)

Choose ONE and adjust 1–2 words to match your real work.

### Lane I — Institutional/Public
> Software engineer focused on backend systems, integrations, and operational reliability in structured environments. I build and maintain long-lived systems with an emphasis on auditability, documentation, and safe change management.  
>
> I use automation and AI as assisted tooling within explicit human-in-the-loop workflows, keeping outputs reviewable and traceable.  
>
> Proof: see Featured artifacts (repo/demo/design notes).

### Lane P1 — Private Balanced
> Software engineer focused on backend systems, integrations, and production reliability. I ship practical features end-to-end: API design, data workflows, automation, and operational support.  
>
> I use AI as assisted tooling (evaluation, logging, cost control) to accelerate iteration while keeping outputs reviewable.  
>
> Proof: see Featured (shipped projects and write-ups).

### Lane P2 — Startup Execution
> Engineer who ships to production. I build backend services, integrations, and automation with a bias for delivery and clear ownership. I’m comfortable iterating quickly while keeping systems operable (logging, monitoring, rollback-ready changes).  
>
> Proof: Featured shows demos, repos, and short project notes.

### Lane P3 — Public-adjacent B2B
> Software engineer building customer-facing systems where trust, operability, and maintainability matter. I focus on integrations, reliability, documentation, and support readiness across long-lived platforms.  
>
> Proof: Featured includes shipped artifacts and technical notes.

Rules:
- Keep About to ~6–10 lines total
- Avoid vendor/model lists
- Ensure the proof is in Featured, not paragraphs here

## Featured (Pin 2–4)

Recommended set:
- 1 repo or demo (clean README)
- 1 short architecture or design note (public-safe)
- 1 project write-up (problem → approach → result)
- optional: resume PDF

Order:
1) strongest proof
2) second strongest proof
3) design note
4) resume (optional)
