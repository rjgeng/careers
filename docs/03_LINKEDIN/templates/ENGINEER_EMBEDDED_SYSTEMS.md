## About (Copy/Paste)

Choose ONE.

### Lane I — Institutional/Public
> Engineer with hands-on experience building and maintaining practical systems. I focus on safe operation, reliability, documentation, and methodical debugging across long-lived environments.  
>
> Comfortable working across software/hardware interfaces, with attention to traceability and maintainable design.  
>
> Proof: see Featured technical artifacts and write-ups.

### Lane P1 — Private Balanced
> Embedded/systems engineer focused on clear execution: bring-up, debugging, integration, and steady delivery. I build maintainable solutions with practical testing and documentation.  
>
> Proof: Featured includes projects, technical notes, or demos.

### Lane P2 — Startup Execution
> Engineer who builds and debugs quickly. I bring systems from idea to working prototype to stable release, iterating fast while keeping changes testable and operable.  
>
> Proof: Featured includes shipped artifacts and concise write-ups.

### Lane P3 — Public-adjacent B2B
> Engineer focused on delivery and supportability for customer-facing systems. I prioritize reliability, integration discipline, documentation, and field readiness over flashy complexity.  
>
> Proof: Featured includes technical artifacts and write-ups.

Rules:
- Keep ~5–8 lines
- Avoid claims without artifacts
- Don’t exaggerate; let proof do the work

## Featured (Pin 2–4)

Recommended:
- 1 technical repo or demo
- 1 debugging/integration write-up (short)
- 1 design note or architecture sketch (public-safe)
- optional: certification/training proof (only if relevant)
