# LinkedIn Featured — Order & Captions

This document defines the **exact order and captions** for LinkedIn’s *Featured* section.

The goal is to project **Senior IC signal**, system thinking, and focus — without oversharing or appearing defensive.

Only the documents listed here should be featured.

---

## Featured Item 1 (Primary)

**Title**  
Career as a System

**Link to**  
docs/02_RESUME_ATS/CAREER_AS_A_SYSTEM.md

**Caption (paste verbatim)**  
I treat my career the same way I build systems: constraints, feedback loops, and measurable signals.

**Why this goes first**  
Establishes mindset immediately. Frames everything else.

---

## Featured Item 2 (Secondary)

**Title**  
System Design Interview Notes

**Link to**  
docs/04_INTERVIEW_PREP/SYSTEM_DESIGN_BANK.md

**Caption (paste verbatim)**  
A concise system-design reference I maintain for interview preparation and architectural clarity.

**Why this goes second**  
Demonstrates concrete technical depth after mindset.

## Featured Item 3 (Optional)

**Title**  
Career Infrastructure Overview

**Link to**  
docs/00_START_HERE.md

**Caption (paste verbatim)**  
Overview of how I organize resume artifacts, interview prep, and role selection as a coherent system.

**Why this is optional**  
Useful for curious reviewers; not required for first impression.

---

## Items Explicitly Not Featured

Do **not** feature resumes, age-aware analysis, doctrine, or strategy drafts.

Those are supporting materials, not public signals.

---

## Maintenance Rule

Revisit Featured links only when:

- Role targets change
- Core positioning changes
- You materially update system design content

Otherwise, leave unchanged.
