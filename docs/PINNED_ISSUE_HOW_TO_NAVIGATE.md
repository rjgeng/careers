# How to Navigate This Repository

This repository is intentionally structured and not meant to be read end-to-end.

If you are a recruiter, hiring manager, or reviewer, here is the recommended path.

---

## 1. Start with Context

Read **docs/00_START_HERE.md** for scope and intent.

This explains what this repository is — and what it is not.

---

## 2. Understand the Mindset

Read **docs/02_RESUME_ATS/CAREER_AS_A_SYSTEM.md**.

This describes how I approach career positioning and job search using engineering principles.

---

## 3. Assess Technical Readiness

Skim **docs/04_INTERVIEW_PREP/SYSTEM_DESIGN_BANK.md**.

This shows how I reason about systems at a senior individual contributor level.

---

## 4. Optional: See Scope & Focus

Read **docs/01_POSITIONING/ROLE_TARGETS.md** if you want to understand what roles I am targeting and why.

---

## Notes

- All content is non-proprietary and based on personal experience
- Internal drafts and strategy notes live outside the main docs path
- This repository is a reference, not a portfolio of production code

Thank you for taking the time to review.
