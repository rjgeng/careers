# Start Here

This repository documents my **career as a system**, not a collection of ad-hoc applications.

It contains ATS-safe resume artifacts, interview preparation materials, role-filtering logic, and portfolio narratives aligned with real hiring signals.

The goal is to reduce randomness in job search by applying engineering principles: constraints, feedback loops, and measurable outcomes.

All content is derived from non-proprietary work and personal experience.

Production work lives elsewhere; this repo is strictly **career infrastructure**.

Most readers should start with **Positioning**, **Resume & ATS**, and **Interview Prep**.

The **Job Search Engine** section describes how roles are evaluated and prioritized.

Portfolio summaries map real projects to resume bullets and system-design discussions.

Appendix materials provide context, not requirements.

This repository is intentionally opinionated and pragmatic.

It favors signal clarity over breadth.

Treat it as a reference, not a blog.
