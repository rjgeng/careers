# Staff Rubric Mapping (Behavior → Staff Signals)

**Status:** Draft 0.1  
**Purpose:** Translate Rongjun’s demonstrated behaviors into industry-standard Staff Engineering signals.

---

## 1. System Ownership

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Owns systems end-to-end | Defined cross-repo authority (Resume ↔ Careers ↔ Jobify-AI ↔ Shipping) | README, GOVERNANCE, CANON |
| Maintains source of truth | Built CANON and enforced boundaries | 4G-ENG Shipping/CANON.md |
| Treats repos as living systems | Stabilized repo trees across all repos | Consistent layout everywhere |

---

## 2. Architectural Judgment

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Picks simplest solution that works | AI advisory → never authoritative | ADR-013, Jobify governance |
| Enforces boundaries | Process authority vs content authority vs advisory roles | CONTRACT blocks in repos |
| Documents “why” | Uses ADRs and governance rules | ADR templates + decision logs |

---

## 3. Creates Repeatable Processes

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Converts chaos → stable workflows | Wrote RB-010 Git hygiene | RUNBOOKS.md |
| Writes checklists for others | Commit workflow, diff-safety, rg-search patterns | Git hygiene doc |
| Designs scalable systems | System usable by wife + brother + future contributors | Resume & Careers integration |

---

## 4. Reduces Risk Across the System

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Prevents silent failures | Runs link audits, rg queries, governance checks | Daily workflows |
| Ensures reversibility | Never overwrites: always compensating entries, runbooks | RUNBOOK principles |
| Maintains long-term maintainability | Predictable repo architecture | Shipping repo and Careers repo layout |

---

## 5. Technical Leadership Without Authority

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Influences through clarity | Creates frameworks others can adopt | CANON, ADRs, position docs |
| Enables others to be productive | Makes work navigable for wife/brother | External Authority contract |
| Writes onboarding-quality docs | START_HERE.md patterns | All repos now have onboarding structure |

---

## 6. Broad Cross-System Impact

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Works across multiple domains | AI, backend, resume systems, governance, documentation | Multi-repo changes |
| Creates leverage that scales | Resume/Career/Jobify system supports multiple people | Multi-lane applicability |
| Produces durable artifacts | ADRs, rubrics, templates, governance rules | All recently created |

---

## 7. Makes the System Legible

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Converts complexity → clarity | Restructured every repo | Careers/Resume/Jobify/Shipping |
| Writes system documents | CANON, START_HERE, RUNBOOKS | Canonical sources |
| Establishes shared language | “External Authorities”, “Contracts”, “Canon Tag” | Governance MDs |

---

## 8. Strategic Thinking

| Staff Signal | Your Behavior | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Thinks 6–18 months ahead | Infrastructure built for future team | Cross-repo design |
| Understands cost, risk, governance | Treats repos as systems of contracts | Governance ADRs |
| Aligns tech choices with goals | System supports family careers + 4G-ENG product | All decision patterns |
