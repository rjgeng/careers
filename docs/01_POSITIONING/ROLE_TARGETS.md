# Career Strategy — Hybrid Path (Gate Keys + Leverage)

> This document explains **why** a hybrid strategy is the correct path for me right now, **how** to execute it without losing my identity, and **when** to pivot from interview-optimization to long-term leverage.

This is not motivational. It is an engineering decision under constraints.

---

## 1. Problem Statement (The Real One)

I am **not** lacking technical depth.

The constraint is:

* Limited external signal in a market optimized for **standardized filters** (ATS, coding screens, rubric-based system design)
* A mismatch between **what I am good at** (system-level reasoning, control planes, failure modes, AI orchestration)
  and **what is easy to evaluate quickly** (LeetCode speed, canonical diagrams)

Therefore, the question is not:

> “Am I senior enough?”

The correct question is:

> **“What unlocks the next constraint?”**

## 2. Two Common Paths (And Why Each Alone Is Wrong)

### Path A — Interview-Optimized (Alice-style)

**Strengths**:

* High pass rate
* Clear expectations
* Fast feedback
* Works well for L3–L5 roles

**Weaknesses (for me)**:

* Over-invests in memorization
* Under-uses my strongest skills
* Competes me directly with specialists who do nothing else

Conclusion: **Effective but incomplete**.

---

### Path B — Pure Systems Builder (My natural tendency)

**Strengths**:

* Deep reasoning
* Strong architectural judgment
* Long-term leverage
* Staff-level instincts

**Weaknesses (market reality)**:

* Hard to signal
* Slow validation
* Recruiters often misclassify or skip

Conclusion: **Correct direction, wrong timing**.

## 3. The Correct Strategy: Hybrid, Sequenced

The optimal solution is **not compromise**.
It is **sequencing**.

### Phase 1 — Get the Key (3–6 months)

**Objective**: Re-enter hiring funnels with minimal wasted motion.

Rules:

* LeetCode = gate key, not identity
* Time-boxed, pattern-based only
* System design = expected answers, not philosophy

Success criteria:

* Can pass coding screens reliably
* Can speak interviewer vocabulary fluently
* Do *not* overshare depth prematurely

This phase is **instrumental**.

---

### Phase 2 — Apply Leverage (inside interviews / projects)

Once access is restored, shift gears.

This is where I lean into:

* Control-plane thinking
* Explicit failure handling
* Cost-aware AI systems
* Observability and replayability

At this stage:

* Strong engineers recognize the difference
* Conversations move beyond memorization
* I differentiate naturally

This phase is **identity-aligned**.

---

### Phase 3 — Exit the Funnel (long-term)

The end goal is **not** permanent interview optimization.

It is:

* Owning a niche
* Being evaluated on judgment, not trivia
* Reducing dependence on standardized funnels

Examples:

* AI orchestration platforms
* Infra / backend / applied AI roles
* Technical leadership paths

This phase is **leverage-maximizing**.

---

## 4. What I Will Explicitly NOT Do

* I will not grind LeetCode indefinitely
* I will not reduce myself to buzzwords
* I will not confuse speed with seniority
* I will not abandon system thinking to look simpler

Constraints are **tools**, not weaknesses.

---

## 5. Personal Operating Principle (Write Once)

> I will temporarily adopt interview-optimized skills without surrendering my system-builder identity.

This sentence resolves the internal conflict.

---

## 6. How to Use This Document

* Read it when doubt appears
* Use it to explain choices to myself (not others)
* Re-evaluate every 90 days

If Phase 1 drags on → tighten scope.
If Phase 2 never activates → adjust targeting.
If Phase 3 becomes viable → exit consciously.

---

## 7. Final Reminder

Depth without access stalls.
Access without depth caps out.

**Sequencing turns both into advantage.**
