# Career Signals — Full‑Stack + AI (Hiring & Interview Map)

This document is **not about system design**.

It exists to translate your *real architecture work* into **clear hiring signals** for:

* Recruiters
* Hiring managers
* Interview panels

> Purpose: **signal clarity, seniority, and relevance** — without distorting technical truth.

---

## How to Use This Canvas

* Use this for **resume wording**, **LinkedIn framing**, and **interview explanations**
* Do **not** change your architecture because of this file
* This file adapts to the market; your architecture canvas does not

---

## 1️⃣ Role Labels That Match Your Real Work

Your actual work maps cleanly to these mainstream role labels:

* **Senior Software Engineer (Full‑Stack)**
* **AI / ML Platform Engineer**
* **AI Systems Engineer**
* **Backend Engineer (Python / FastAPI)**

> You are *not* a “prompt engineer” and do not present yourself as one.

---

## 2️⃣ How to Signal the AI‑First Architecture (Pattern B)

### What recruiters understand immediately

Say:

* “Built AI‑first services using **FastAPI + PostgreSQL**”
* “Separated AI orchestration from frontend using service boundaries”
* “Designed server‑side AI pipelines with cost control and caching”

Avoid:

* Over‑emphasizing UI libraries
* Explaining RAG internals unless asked

### Interview translation

If asked *“Why FastAPI?”*:

> “Python is the center of gravity for AI. FastAPI gives us a typed, async service layer that scales cleanly and keeps AI logic independent of the UI.”

---

## 3️⃣ How to Signal Web‑First Work (Pattern A)

### What hiring managers want to hear

Say:

* “Used **Next.js App Router** with server actions for data access”
* “Designed server/client boundaries to reduce bundle size and improve performance”
* “Integrated AI features server‑side to protect secrets and control cost”

This signals:

* Modern React literacy
* Production readiness
* System thinking (not just UI)

---

## 4️⃣ Enterprise Stack Awareness (Pattern C — Knowledge Only)

You **acknowledge**, not advocate, this stack.

Say:

* “I’ve worked around enterprise stacks with Angular frontends and Java/.NET or NestJS backends.”
* “AI is typically introduced as Python microservices behind existing systems.”

This reassures enterprise interviewers **without committing you** to that stack.

---

## 5️⃣ Resume Bullet Patterns (Reusable)

Use bullets shaped like this:

* “Designed AI‑first backend services using **FastAPI**, integrating LLM workflows and PostgreSQL persistence.”
* “Built modern web frontends with **Next.js**, leveraging server components and server actions.”
* “Separated AI orchestration from UI to enable independent scaling and rapid iteration.”

---

## 6️⃣ Common Interview Traps (and Safe Responses)

**Trap:** “Why not put everything in Next.js?”

Safe answer:

> “When AI is core, I prefer a dedicated Python service so the AI stack can evolve independently while the frontend stays lightweight.”

---

**Trap:** “Why not MongoDB?”

Safe answer:

> “PostgreSQL gives us transactional integrity plus JSON flexibility, which works well for both web and AI workloads.”

---

## 7️⃣ What This Canvas Is *Not*

* Not a tech roadmap
* Not a stack decision guide
* Not a learning plan

Those belong elsewhere.

---

## Final Career Rule

> **Build systems for correctness.**
> **Explain them for humans.**

This canvas handles the second part.
