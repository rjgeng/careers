# ADR-001: Cross-Repo Interaction (Reference Only)

## Status
Accepted

## Decision
Careers defines career process and decision frameworks.
Jobify-AI implements a constrained subset of Careers rules as software.
Resume remains private and human-authoritative.

## References
The authoritative boundary and governance decisions are maintained in Jobify-AI:
- ADR-010 (Repo boundaries)
- ADR-011 (Careers as process authority)
- ADR-012 (Resume versioning out of scope)

Careers will reference these ADRs but will not duplicate them.
