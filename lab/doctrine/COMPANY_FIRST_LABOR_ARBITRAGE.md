# Company-First Labor Arbitrage Doctrine

**Status:** Active Doctrine
**Owner:** 4G ENG (Founder-Controlled)
**Scope:** Career, hiring, contracting, and public signaling decisions

---

## 1. Strategy Name

### **Company-First Labor Arbitrage Strategy**

**Definition**
4G ENG is the primary long-term asset.

Employment, consulting, or contract work is engaged **selectively and tactically** to:

* stabilize or extend company runway
* harvest durable skills and system-level experience
* read market and hiring signals early
* preserve strategic optionality

Labor is a **tool**, not an identity.
Employment must never redefine the company’s direction, ownership, or public narrative.

---

## 2. Strategic Intent (Why This Exists)

This strategy exists to resolve a real constraint:

> Early- and mid-stage company builders must often operate inside imperfect capital markets.

Rather than pretending otherwise, this doctrine makes labor engagement:

* explicit
* bounded
* non-destructive to founder leverage

The goal is **control, not optimization**.

---

## 3. Allowed Job Types

The following work is explicitly allowed **only if it strengthens 4G ENG**:

### ✅ Allowed

* **Short- to medium-term employment**

  * roles with clear end dates or review checkpoints
  * no exclusivity beyond working hours

* **Contract / consulting work**

  * clearly scoped deliverables
  * low political exposure

* **Roles that improve core capability**

  * systems engineering
  * backend / infrastructure
  * AI systems, tooling, or platform work
  * RF / embedded / FPGA adjacent roles

* **Signal-harvesting roles**

  * positions that expose real hiring standards
  * companies with strong engineering cultures

Each engagement must satisfy **at least one**:

* runway extension
* skill compounding
* signal acquisition

---

## 4. Forbidden Job Types

The following work is **explicitly forbidden**, regardless of pay:

### ❌ Forbidden

* Roles that demand **identity replacement**

  * “full alignment” or loyalty narratives
  * public role definitions incompatible with founder status

* Roles that block company progress

  * excessive overtime with no skill return
  * on-call obligations that erode control

* Pure hype or bubble roles

  * vague AI evangelism
  * title inflation without real systems work

* Public-facing spokesperson roles

  * anything that confuses who you represent

If a role requires you to **hide or downplay 4G ENG**, it violates this doctrine.

---

## 5. Public vs Private Signaling Rules

### Public Surface (LinkedIn, resumes, external view)

* Primary identity: **Founder / System Builder (4G ENG)**
* Employment is presented as:

  * consulting
  * engineering work
  * project-based contribution

Never present as:

* “seeking direction”
* “career pivoting”
* “starting over”

---

### Private Operations (actual strategy)

* Employment is treated as:

  * capital inflow
  * intelligence gathering
  * skill extraction

* Exit is always assumed unless proven otherwise

Recruiters, employers, and networks do **not** need full context.

---

## 6. Decision Gate (Before Accepting Any Role)

Before accepting work, answer:

1. Does this extend runway **without reducing control**?
2. Does it compound skills relevant to 4G ENG?
3. Does it provide real market signal?
4. Is exit clean and survivable?

If **two or more answers are “no”**, decline.

---

## 7. Exit Conditions (When Labor Stops)

Labor engagement should stop or sharply reduce when **any** of the following are true:

* 4G ENG achieves stable cash flow
* external labor no longer materially extends runway
* opportunity cost exceeds benefit
* labor begins to distort company priorities

Exit is a **success condition**, not a failure.

---

## 8. Doctrine Enforcement

This doctrine overrides:

* short-term fear
* social pressure
* résumé vanity

Violations must be treated as **strategic errors**, not emotional ones.

---

**This doctrine exists to preserve founder leverage, clarity, and long-term control.**
