**Grandma**, I don’t think of you every day because you are already inside me, but when I am alone and the world is quiet, the tears still come. You walked away from famine, from death, from a home that betrayed you, and you never looked back, yet you carried the future forward with your bare hands. You did not know what a university was, but you knew a child could escape hunger, so you sold eggs, saved coins, and believed when there was no reason to believe. People laughed, history was broken, and still you insisted. I went farther than the village, farther than the land you crossed, and even when I crossed oceans, you were not afraid, because you had already survived worse. I was not there when you left this world, and that sorrow stays with me, but I know you did not wait, because your work was already done. You asked me to take care of my father and leave the hard land behind, and I did. Your suffering stopped with you. Your life did not. It continues quietly, through me.
