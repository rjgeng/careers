# Engineering Leveling Strategy

This document is a **strategy wrapper** for choosing and presenting an engineering level (Senior vs Staff) in job targeting, outreach, resume packaging, and interview storytelling.

**Canonical checklist (tactical):**

* `docs/04_INTERVIEW_PREP/checklists/SENIOR_STAFF_ENGINEERING_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## 1) Purpose

* Decide whether to target **Senior** or **Staff** (or run both lanes intentionally).
* Ensure your materials (resume/LinkedIn/interviews) match the chosen level.
* Avoid “level mismatch” signals (too tactical for Staff; too vague for Senior).

---

## 2) Definitions (practical)

### Senior Engineer

Primary identity: **independent owner inside a team**

* Owns a problem area end-to-end within one team.
* Delivers large features/systems with solid design and execution.
* Mentors locally; improves team quality and delivery.

### Staff Engineer

Primary identity: **multiplier across teams**

* Sets direction for a technical area across multiple teams.
* Leads multi-quarter initiatives with dependencies and adoption.
* Creates leverage: platforms, standards, migration playbooks, reusable architecture.

---

## 3) Lane decision rules

### Choose **Senior** when

* Your strongest evidence is **hands-on delivery** (features, systems, performance wins).
* You have limited recent examples of cross-team governance, platform adoption, or org-wide standards.
* You want faster hiring loops and clearer interview mapping.

### Choose **Staff** when

* You can demonstrate **cross-team influence** with adoption outcomes.
* You have clear examples of leading technical direction, de-risking, and stakeholder alignment.
* You can tell 2–3 stories where the result required coordination beyond one team.

### Run **two lanes** intentionally when

* You can present a crisp Senior narrative **and** a credible Staff narrative.
* You keep documents clean: one resume per lane, one story bank per lane.
* You accept that some companies will “down-level” you (and you are OK with it).

---

## 4) Evidence model (what counts)

Use the checklist file as the scoring rubric. For strategy decisions, focus on evidence density:

### Staff-grade evidence examples

* A platform/tool adopted by multiple teams (with measurable impact).
* A migration program (phased rollout, playbooks, deprecation plan).
* A reliability/SLO program across services, with incident reduction.
* A governance pattern (API standards, schema evolution discipline, security controls).

### Senior-grade evidence examples

* Delivered a complex system/service end-to-end.
* Major performance/cost/reliability improvement with measured impact.
* Ownership of an important operational surface (on-call, incident handling, runbooks).
* Mentoring that improved throughput/quality on the team.

---

## 5) Packaging strategy (materials)

### Resume

* Senior resume: emphasize **delivery**, ownership, technical depth, measurable outcomes.
* Staff resume: emphasize **leverage**, direction-setting, cross-team adoption, risk management.

Rule: the top 1/3 of the resume must match the level.

### LinkedIn

* Senior: concrete technical outcomes, “built/shipped/improved.”
* Staff: “led/standardized/migrated/platformed,” with adoption and scale.

### Interview story bank

Maintain two sets of stories:

* Senior stories: 4–6 deep dives on engineering execution.
* Staff stories: 2–3 cross-team initiatives + 2 deep technical dives (credibility).

---

## 6) Interview positioning

### Senior positioning

* “I own systems end-to-end, ship reliably, and improve the team’s output.”

### Staff positioning

* “I set direction for an area, align teams, de-risk delivery, and create leverage.”

Avoid blending both in the first 2 minutes. Pick one as the default, then add range.

---

## 7) Common failure modes

* **Staff claim without adoption proof:** designs exist, but no org-level outcome.
* **Too tactical for Staff:** only implementation details, no direction/coordination.
* **Too abstract for Senior:** only principles, no hard execution outcomes.
* **Mixed signals:** resume reads Staff; interview answers read Senior (or vice versa).

---

## 8) Operating loop (weekly)

* Review active roles and assign a lane: Senior or Staff.
* For each role, pick 3 stories that match the lane.
* Update one artifact weekly:

  * resume bullets (lane-specific)
  * LinkedIn featured order
  * interview story bank

---

## 9) Next improvements

* Add a 1-page **lane scorecard** with weights (Senior vs Staff).
* Add a **story bank template** (Situation/Constraints/Decision/Tradeoffs/Impact).
* Add a **role filter** section mapping job descriptions to lane signals.
